          When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me,
          but I wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Caffe Strada and I
          became reaquainted with the combination of fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup.
          Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored
          carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Caffe Strada also have no cream in them (or maybe
          they do if you ask; I haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative
          for the times when you're feeling a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.

            When your boba craving strikes, head over to Sharetea, a cute little bubble tea shop
            on Bancroft Way. The menu is your standard bubble tea fare with nothing too
            adventurous on the menu -- no bubble tea floats, for example -- but the tapioca is
            fresh, the service is fast, and the tea is smooth and delicious! They have little bites
            to eat too, like popcorn chicken and eggrolls, in perfect snack-size portions. There's
            not too much seating, but there's a cute outdoor area in the back for warmer days.

            Sharetea isn't exactly on campus, but the boba tea has got you covered. Walk from Sproul Hall to Bancroft Wy and enjoy your cuppa tea.

            I can't tell you whether Caffe Milano has a particularly amazing Vanilla Bean Latte, only
            because Caffe Milano is the only place I've ever ordered a Vanilla Bean Latte from. I'm not
            even totally sure I know what a Vanilla Bean Latte is supposed to taste like. What I
            do know is the Vanilla Bean Latte I ordered on a whim from Caffe Milano was delicious.
