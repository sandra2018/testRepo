				 <h1>Latte</h1>

				<p>
					I can't tell you whether Cafe X has a particularly amazing Vanilla Bean Latte, only because Cafe X is the only place I've ever ordered a Vanilla Bean Latte from. I'm not even totally sure I know what a Vanilla Bean Latte is supposed to taste like. What I do know is the Vanilla Bean Latte I ordered on a whim from CoHo was delicious.</br>Recommendation: Vanilla Bean Latte

				 <h1>Italian Soda</h1>

				<p>
					When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me, but I wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Soda Hall and I became reaquainted with the combination of fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have no cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask; I haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative for the times when you're feeling a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.</br>Recommendation: Raspberry Italian soda.

				<h1>Bubble Tea</h1>

				<p>
					When your boba craving strikes, head over to The Tea Bar, a cute little bubble tea shop on Oxford Street. The menu is your standard bubble tea fare with nothing too adventurous on the menu -- no bubble tea floats, for example -- but the tapioca is fresh, the service is fast, and the tea is smooth and delicious! They have little bites to eat too, like popcorn chicken and eggrolls, in perfect snack-size portions. There's not too much seating, but there's a cute outdoor area in the back for warmer days. The Tea Bar isn't exactly on campus, but the Marguerite has got you covered. </br>Recommendation: Classic Milk Tea with tapioca + an order of eggrolls.
